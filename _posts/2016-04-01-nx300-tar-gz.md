title: nx300.tar.gz sources for Samsung NX300 camera
---

I noticed that Samsung has removed sources for NX300 mirrorless camera from their [opensource.samsung.com](http://opensource.samsung.com) site. 
Since I already downloaded this very interesting piece of code (i.e. it contains whole kernel source with all 
custom Samsung drivers etc), I want to keep it for society.
